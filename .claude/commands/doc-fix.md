Document a bug fix or issue resolution.

Instructions:
1. Get the current git commit hash (post-fix state)
2. Ask for or identify:
   - What was the bug/issue?
   - How was it discovered?
   - What was the root cause?
   - What was the fix?
   - How was it verified?
3. Add an entry to the relevant code review document if one exists, OR
4. Create a new document in `docs/code-reviews/` titled `YYYY-MM-DD-{component}-fix.md`
5. Include before/after code snippets if relevant
6. Note any related issues that should be checked

This creates an audit trail for the technical report.
